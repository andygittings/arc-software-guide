Using R on ARC
==============

R is a powerful free software environment for statistical computing.  
It provides access to a wide variety of statistical methods (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification,
clustering, etc.) as well as to graphical techniques.  R is highly extensible and a large number of additional libraries are available.  
A number of libraries are already installed on the ARC systems and more can be installed on request.

R has fairly frequent releases and we try to keep up to date.  Check the versions available using ``module spider R``  
To avoid incompatibilities, each new R installation uses its own installation of the supported libraries.
